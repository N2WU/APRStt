Configuration files and setup for the West Point Triathlon using APRS touchtone

**APRStt.conf**
This file is what is inserted into direwolf.conf. It contains all the reporting procedures for the race.

**Commsproc.txt**
This file has the psuedocode and reasons for the code in APRStt.conf. 

**direwolf.conf**

This is the actual direwolf config. It uses the W2KGY callsign, so change it to your own.
