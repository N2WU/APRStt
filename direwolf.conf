# Concise "man" pages are also available for Linux.
#
# This sample file does not have examples for all of the possibilities.
# Consult the User Guide for more details on configuration options.%C%#
#
# These are the most likely settings you might change:
#
#	(1)   	MYCALL 	-  call sign and SSID for your station.
#
#			Look for lines starting with MYCALL and
#			change NOCALL to your own.
#
#	(2)	PBEACON	-  enable position beaconing.
#
#			Look for lines starting with PBEACON and
#			modify for your call, location, etc.
#
#	(3)	DIGIPEATER  -  configure digipeating rules.
#
#			Look for lines starting with DIGIPEATER.
#			Most people will probably use the given example.
#			Just remove the "#" from the start of the line
#			to enable it.
#
#	(4)	IGSERVER, IGLOGIN  - IGate server and login
#
#			Configure an IGate client to relay messages between
#			radio and internet servers.
#
#
# The default location is "direwolf.conf" in the current working directory.
# On Linux, the user's home directory will also be searched.
# An alternate configuration file location can be specified with the "-c" command line option.
#
# As you probably guessed by now, # indicates a comment line.
#
# Remove the # at the beginning of a line if you want to use a sample
# configuration that is currently commented out.
#
# Commands are a keyword followed by parameters.
#
# Command key words are case insensitive.  i.e. upper and lower case are equivalent.
#
# Command parameters are generally case sensitive.  i.e. upper and lower case are different.

#
# Linux ALSA is complicated.  See User Guide for discussion.
# To use something other than the default, generally use plughw

# ADEVICE  plughw:1,0

# You can also use "-" or "stdin" to pipe stdout from
# some other application such as a software defined radio.
# "stdin" is not an audio device.  Don't use this unless you

#
# The following MYCALL, MODEM, PTT, etc. configuration items
# apply to the most recent CHANNEL.
#

#
# Station identifier for this channel.
# Multiple channels can have the same or different names.
#
# It can be up to 6 letters and digits with an optional ssid.
# The APRS specification requires that it be upper case.
#
# Example (don't use this unless you are me):  MYCALL	WB2OSZ-5
#

MYCALL W2KGY-3

#
# Pick a suitable modem speed based on your situation.
#	1200 	Most common for VHF/UHF.  Default if not specified.
#	2400	QPSK compatible with MFJ-2400, and probably PK232-2400 & KPC-2400.
#	300	Low speed for HF SSB.  Default tones 1600 & 1800.
#	EAS	Emergency Alert System (EAS) Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME).
#	9600	G3RUH style - Can't use Microphone and Speaker connections.
#	AIS	International system for tracking ships on VHF.
#			Also uses 9600 bps so Speaker connection won't work.
#
# In most cases you can just specify the speed.  Examples:
#

MODEM 1200
#MODEM 9600

#
# Many options are available for great flexibility.
# See User Guide for details.
#

#
# Uncomment line below to enable the DTMF decoder for this channel.
#

DTMF

# If using a C-Media CM108/CM119 or similar USB Audio Adapter,
# you can use a GPIO pin for PTT control. This is very convenient
# because a single USB connection is used for both audio and PTT.
# Example:

#PTT CM108

# The transmitter Push to Talk (PTT) control can be wired to a serial port
# with a suitable interface circuit.  DON'T connect it directly!
#
# For the PTT command, specify the device and either RTS or DTR.
# RTS or DTR may be preceded by "-" to invert the signal.
# Both can be used for interfaces that want them driven with opposite polarity.
#
# COM1 can be used instead of /dev/ttyS0, COM2 for /dev/ttyS1, and so on.
#

#PTT COM1 RTS
#PTT COM1 RTS -DTR
#PTT /dev/ttyUSB0 RTS

#
# On Linux, you can also use general purpose I/O pins if
# your system is configured for user access to them.
# This would apply mostly to microprocessor boards, not a regular PC.
# See separate Raspberry Pi document for more details.
# The number may be preceded by "-" to invert the signal.
#

#PTT GPIO 25

# The Data Carrier Detect (DCD) signal can be sent to the same places
# as the PTT signal.  This could be used to light up an LED like a normal TNC.

#DCD COM1 -DTR
#DCD GPIO 24
